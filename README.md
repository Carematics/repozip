repozip
=======

A project enabling download of subversion (and eventually other) repos as zip files.

In order to provide isolation for the checking out of repositories, we are trying docker.
The docker container we are using is published to the docker index here: 

https://index.docker.io/u/eldondev/goodsvn/

It is based on ubuntu precise with subversion and zip utilities added.
